# So You Want To Sell Your App Outside the Mac App Store ...

> Writing your own app store and licensor is a rite of passage.  
> ---Wil Shipley

I wrote this book to save you a ton of work. Depending on your experience level, this book might save you days or weeks if you had to start from scratch and research, implement, and test everything on your own. I know because it took me ages to get confident in the process back in 2013 when I figured things out for my first commercial macOS app, _WordCounter_. It was a lot of extra work I'd rather have skipped for my first commercial product. I can still remember my high levels of anxiety when I started to implement the parts that make an app purchase-able. It's very embarrassing if things go wrong, especially when it comes to other people's money. Understandably, people get angry when their credit card is charged and they don't receive a working product in return. So I wanted to make sure that absolutely nothing could go wrong. How-to's on the intricacies are few and far between. In this book, you'll learn everything to turn your app into a product that can be sold.

With the Mac App Store, you only have to provide a working binary, upload it, pass the review, and that's it. You can focus on the features you want, no need to worry about the infrastructure. That sounds like a compelling argument at first since it removes much of the perceived burden, but you'll see that the things you learn from this book aren't complicated at all. They're just not talked about a lot and thus result in a lot of wasted time fiddling around. This book fixes that problem for you.

Remember the decision to sell _outside_ the Mac App Store does not prevent you from selling _inside_ the Mac App Store. It could make sense to ditch the App Store completely, but it can also make sense to try to reach different audiences via different platforms in parallel.

I'm all for empowering developers to achieve their goals. The Mac App Store might hinder you on your way; here's a short rundown of things you should consider when you figure out how you want to sell your app so we're both on the same page:

- Can you pull of your own marketing? The App Store may be an uninspiring warehouse, but it's a warehouse your old aunt might learn to operate and find stuff in. The discoverability on the App Store might be minuscule without any marketing, but its greater than 0.
- Can your app be Sandboxed easily? If not, the App Store won't be viable.
- Do you want to participate in bundle sales? App Store doesn't do that.
- Do you want to provide education or bulk discounts? 
- Does your business target other businesses, and do you regularly need to provide non-personalized bulk licenses? If so, you will want the flexibility of an e-commerce provider like FastSpring.
- Do you want to experiment with business models like cross-platform subscriptions? Might be way easier to pull off on your own.
- Do you want to make piracy of your app harder, for example by validating how many machine someone can run your app on? Then you will want to activate apps via your own servers.
- Will your business suffer if Apple pulls your app from the Store, even if by mistake? It's a numbers game: a sufficiently large corporation like Apple will eventually make mistakes. PayPal and amazon are known for closing accounts a bit too proactively. Maybe you remember the incident when the popular API documentation app _Dash_ was pulled from the App Store and its dev was very happy to have another way to sell his app. I strongly advise you set up a safety net to make your business less fragile.
- Do you want to cut cost? FastSpring has a flat fee of 8.9% per transaction, as opposed to Apple's 30% cut _after deducting value-added tax (VAT)._ Say you sell an app for €9.99 to a German customer. After a 19% VAT reduction of €1.90, Apple takes 30% of the remaining €8.09 and you'll earn a depressing €5.66 -- whereas the same app sold via FastSpring would leave you with €8.14.

The folks of MacPaw and later Setapp conduct regular surveys about the state of the Mac developer happiness you might want to check out if you want to know more about the obstacles developers face.[^res] 

As of this edition's release, I am selling four macOS apps with the techniques outlined in this book, one of them also available on the Mac App Store, and I helped clients set up their apps for sale on FastSpring, too. Meanwhile, this book goes beyond the mere personal preference of yours truly and will teach you the implicit industry standards of selling outside the App Store I discovered from interviews with senior independent Mac developers.
