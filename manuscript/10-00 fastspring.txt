# Set up Your App for Sale on FastSpring

In this chapter, we'll configure your app listing for your very own store. FastSpring will process your purchases. Their backend will take care of all the license code generation during the checkout process. This is part of the "order fulfillment" we're going to configure. 

FastSpring offers two store backends in parallel: The old one, called "Classic Commerce", and the new one introduced in 2016, called "Contextual Commerce". Both systems differed for quite a while, but nowadays, I think it's safe to say that Contextual is the clear winner for app developers because it is on par in features and even exceeds Classic. You get a proper REST API in Contextual, and a much nicer checkout experience. Order confirmation emails aren't ugly anymore, either! 

I'll show you how you can set up both store backends, but will focus on the functionality of Contextual because it's clearly the way forward.

To see what you can do with the Contextual store, have a look at the examples and demos on <https://www.fastspringexamples.com/>. You'll see that the FastSpring Contextual Commerce backend can power a shopping cart _on your own website._ The examples include a preview of different settings, too, for example how the checkout form differs from selling digital to selling physical goods.

Contextual is the new default when you create an account. You can later opt-in to add access to the Classic store to your account via a support ticket. The same applies if you find you didn't get access to the Contextual backend initially: just ask the support team to put you on the other backend, too.

To get started, head to FastSpring's [sign-up page](https://www.fastspring.com/sign-up) if you don't have an account already. Account activation may take a little while because it involves a human. 

If you already have an account set-up, great! Proceed to the next section in this chapter.

If you still wait for account approval, you may want to skim the following sections to get a feel for the process and the parts involved, and come back later to create the store listing. In the meantime, head to the next chapter and learn how you can prepare your app to be activated via license codes.
