# What this book is about

* you want to release a Mac app outside the Mac App Store
    * use your own license code generator
* set up FastSpring as the store and license code generator
* add license verification to your existing app
* add a time-based trial
* use the embedded store to increase conversion

## Getting a few technical terms straight up front

We'll be talking about "keys" and "codes" a lot. To remedy confusion, here's a list of technical terms which are going to be important.

FastSpring
: Store front

CocoaFob
: Set algorithms, available as Open Source scripts, to generate and verify license codes 
: https://github.com/glebd/cocoafob

Private Key
: OpenSSL-generated hash you should keep private

Public Key
: OpenSSL-generated hash used for 3rd parties to encrypt data which can be decrypted using the private key

License Code
: The string of characters your customers will receive after they buy your app

License Code Verification
: The process in your app: user enters a code, the app verifies it's validity. Verified license codes result in unlocking the application.
