There are two projects included:

* `No-Trial-Verify-at-Start`: the simple one. The real application is blocked until the user registers as a paying customer. It supports buying a license from within the app using the Embedded Web Store SDK by FastSpring.
* `Trial-Expire-While-Running`: the complex one. A time-based trial means the app is unlocked from day 1 until the trial expires. Then the application will lock itself and urge the user to register or buy. Also supports buying a license from within the app.

Both projects use secure license code verification, powered by CocoaFob.

License code generation will be powered by FastSpring, as explained in the next chapter.

Once your product is set up with FastSpring, you need to add the details to `FastSpringCredentials.plist` which is used by the sample apps to load the embedded store with the correct details.

As the project navigator will reveal, I have taken quite an effort to structure the Swift code into well-encapsulated components. They are thoroughly unit tested as well.

The root folder of the project contains the obligatory `AppDelegate`, an `Alerts` vendor, and two major use case objects: `RegisterApplication` and `PurchaseLicense`, both responsible for what it says on the tin.

There are six major groups in the time-trial enabled sample app:

1. **Shared**: Extensions of Swift's standary library which provide useful features; also including a `NSUserDefaults` wrapper used extensively during tests.
2. **Trial**: Contains infrastructure to store and read trial information and install the trial timer.
3. **License**: Contains similar infrastructure and an event broadcaster to notify interested objects in your app about license changes.
4. **License Parsing from URL Scheme**: As we will cover briefly in the appendix, these service objects help to provide activation of your app via e-mail.
5. **FastSpring Store Integration**: Wrapper around the Embedded Store SDK by provided FastSpring to handle order confirmations and provide a clean integration into existing apps.
6. **User Interface**: Contains window controllers for the store window and the license information window.

You can drag & drop all of these files (except `AppDelegate`, `MainMenu.xib`, and `Images.xcassets` of course) into your existing project, adjust a few parameters, extend your own `AppDelegate`, and that's it. No additional action required.
