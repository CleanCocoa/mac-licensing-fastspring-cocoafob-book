## Embedding CocoaFob

For Swift 3, CocoaFob provides a native implementation. If you use Objective-C, refer to [the instructions in the appendix.](#cocoafob-objc)

### Manual Checkout

I tend to add GitHub-based projects as submodules to simple projects like these. That's how the [sample code](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/mac-licensing-fastspring-cocoafob) works, too. I put all of them into an "External" folder. So from the project root of your project, these are the commands you'd have to enter at the command line:

    $ mkdir External
    $ cd External/
    $ git submodule add git://github.com/glebd/cocoafob.git

Alternatively, you can [download the code from GitHub](https://github.com/glebd/cocoafob/tree/master/swift/CocoaFob) and add the files manually.

You're going to need the following files from the `swift/CocoaFob` subfolder:

* `CFUtil.swift`
* `CocoaFobError.swift`
* `CocoaFobLicVerifier.swift`
* `CocoaFobStringExt.swift`

Add them to your Xcode project. That's everything you need to do to prepare the project.

### Dependency Managers

CocoaFob now also provides CocoaPods integration. The resulting library consists of all the stuff you are going to need -- plus a bit more, like license key generation. 

As of early 2017, Carthage and the Swift Package Manager are not supported.
