# What Could Come Next

I'd like to quote Wil Shipley again, this time with an important afterthought:

> Writing your own app store and licensor is a rite of passage. It's actually no fun whatsoever, but I wouldn't want to discourage you from a learning experience.  
> ---Wil Shipley

His words ring true for me: it is a rite of passage of sorts, and it's also no fun to discover anything of the parts on your own. I did find a couple of once useful but ultimately outdated articles back in 2014, so I had to ultimately write everything on my own and do all of the stuff you find in this book from scratch. It was a weird ride. And with the second edition, you see much of what the years after my initial discoveries revealed to be popular and important pieces.

This guide stands the test of time so far. It still puzzles me nobody shares this kind of information, but there you go.

Back in the day, I was stressed out a lot by the prospect of implementing my own licensing scheme, and only after nothing bad happened for a while did I gain confidence in my approach. That was after I shipped my app _WordCounter_ in 2014. Then I replicated the process for another app, _Move!_, extracted reusable pieces of code, eventually transitioned to Swift, wrapped everything in a framework, and began to collect thoughts and write about the journey and lessons learned. This book is the result of my progress thus far. With the increasing popularity of subscriptions and online license activation, it certainly won't be the end of the road.

If you went through everything I had to tell and managed to prepare your app, I sincerely want congratulate you. Welcome in the club of indie developers. You made it through!

If you haven't yet begun selling your app on your own, you can still be happy to have taken this first step towards your own freedom as a creative professional.

What's next? Depends on the road you're taking! From a technical perspective, you could experiment with different licensing approaches. Since subscriptions are all the rage nowadays, this might be a topic you could put more research into, then transition your pricing model accordingly. I don't have a fully working implementation that offers an online activation and subscription management service, but you will find information to tackle this in the following sections of the appendix. Experimenting with pricing models makes sense when you have a paying customer base, but if you just got started selling your first app, you might consider to turn your app-making into a business and create a new product. That means figuring out how to market your products, building an audience, and such. That's a path we won't cover in this book, though.

In the appendix, you'll find more details to implement interesting but optional features. Check out the additional resources on my website, too, and please get in touch if you have questions or feedback!
