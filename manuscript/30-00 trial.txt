# Sample App 2: Adding a Time-Based Trial

Licensing now just works. But having to buy an app without test-driving it is not very comfortable for your users. Especially if your application costs more than $10, which may be considered to be the threshold of impulse purchases, users will want to find out if your product really is for them.

That's where trials come into play. You offer new users a test drive for a limited time so they can decide if they want to keep using the product. Your trial period should be long enough to make your app part of your user's lives or they will shrug the purchase dialog off too easily.

To add a time-based trial to your app, you have to change `LicenseInformation` a bit and add a third intermediate state:

    enum LicenseInformation {
        case Registered(License)
        case OnTrial(TrialPeriod)
        case TrialUp
    }

I experimented with different `TrialPeriod` implementations.

To use a start date and a duration value came natural, but it became unnecessarily clumsy to use. The duration has to be provided by the app in code anyway. And for most timer operations, you have to compute the end date of the trial period, too. So I suggest this instead, in the most basic form:

    struct TrialPeriod {
        public let startDate: NSDate
        public let endDate: NSDate
    }

From there on, this chapter will teach you how to change the existing application to take the trial into account.

**You can find a fully functional sample app incorporating a trial mode in the book's code repository.** It's in the [`Trial-Expire-While-Running` folder.](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-licensing-fastspring-cocoafob/tree/master/Trial-Expire-While-Running)
