### CocoaFob Fulfillment

Pick a name for CocoaFob to use for the licenses. This doesn't have to be the same as your FastSpring product ID or product name (`newapp` or "New App" in my case, respectively). In fact, you can use the product name field of the license generator to include versioning information or whatever you want to differentiate generated licenses.

I picked a license template of `#{product},#{name}` so that each license code is unique per product and licensee. To unlock the app, users have to provide both the license code and the licensee's name.

I prefer this kind of personalized license codes. You could also utilize them to check how often a given license is used and deactivate illegally shared licenses if you're into that kind of thing.

It's important that you don't change the CocoaFob product name if you include `#{product}` in the license template. If you change the template or the template's variables' contents, you have to change the license verification code in your app, so new licenses won't be compatible to old ones and vice versa.

More recently, I've come to take a simpler template into consideration, omitting the licensee's name.

Using a template of `#{product}` only is useful to allow bulk-generating licenses. If you ever want to participate in a bundle sale, this can make things a lot easier as some bundle organizers simply deliver a non-personalized license code from a long list you provide.

To support non-personalized license codes next to your standard personalized license code verification, you'd have to supply a second algorithm (or object) in code which doesn't take the licensee's name into account, even though the form can look the same, of course.

I was lucky to participate in a bundle which we sold via FastSpring, so I could simply duplicate my product settings. See [the bonus content](#sellbundles) at the end of the book for details about bundle setup.
