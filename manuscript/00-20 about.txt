# What This Book Is About

When you distribute outside the Mac App Store, you have to take care of app updates and copy protection yourself. This is extra work. To figure all that out takes quite some time. With the App Store, you only have to provide a working binary, that's it. Implement the features you want, no need to worry about the infrastructure.

I wrote this book to save you days of work, even if you know what you're doing. This book could save you weeks if you had to start from scratch and did all the research, testing, and implementation on your own. I know because it took me ages to get confident in the process and figure things out for my first macOS app. You'll benefit from a fully functional Open Source framework that encapsulates everything I've learned and that works. This alone saves you the time to code and test all the things yourself. Then there's the time I spent on this book, of course, which is time you don't have to spend researching.

The things you will learn from this book aren't complicated. It's just very embarrassing if things go wrong when it comes to money. Your app crashes from time to time? No problem. But if app activation doesn't work after a credit card is charged, people get angry quick. Here, you'll learn how to make things work even though the stakes are high.

I can still remember the high levels of anxiety I experienced when I started to implement the parts that make an app purchase-able. The higher the stakes, the more you may be afraid of the process. This is wasted energy, and I have no clue why nobody in the past showed how to accomplish everything you'll learn in this book.

This book wants to help you become confident in the process. You'll learn techniques that are applied out there in the wild by developers all over the world. Keep in mind that I have skin in the game, too: I sell my own apps on FastSpring and the Mac App Store, and I share with you real-world code snippets from my own applications and the resulting Open Source framework I depend on. To look beyond my own nose and to figure out common practices, I interviewed app developers and asked how they did things. You'll find their voices throughout the book. I also freelanced and set up other people's applications for license-based activation and purchases via FastSpring to improve the process. This makes me very confident in the results I present to you in this little book, and I sure hope it helps you overcome whatever obstacle you're facing, be it fear of the unknown, anxiety of failing badly, or not having the time to work things out for yourself.

## What You'll Learn

From a high-level perspective, you'll learn how to run your own app shop. I won't teach you how to provide the best email support, ever. But apart from support and setting up a website, you'll be pretty much set up to get rolling.

From a technical perspective, you'll learn how to perform the following tasks:

* Set up a product for sale with FastSpring, including license code generation and sending order confirmation e-mails with activation links.
* Guard your app against software piracy to some extent, requiring license code and name to let users pass.
* Add a time-based trial to your application. _You can copy this well-tested code right into your existing app!_
* Implement an activation handler in your app which verifies the license information before unlocking the app. _This, too, can be copied right into your existing app!_

As a bonus, you'll learn a few things about Mac software architecture through well-written, fully functional sample applications which are thoroughly tested. There are more than 200 test cases included in the Open Source code repository alone, plus all the manual field testing of me and my clients!

I'll show you all these things in detail so you can be certain that everything is taken care of:

- how to set up FastSpring as the store where people buy your software,
- add automatic license key generation to the checkout process,
- implement license code verification in you app,
- create a time-based trial,
- offer in-app purchases,
- set up app updates,
- and how to figure out a price and prepare the release.

This book is designed to make your job an independent software developer as simple as possible. When I wrote this book, I had in mind how hard selling my first Mac app was, so I try to tackle the usual worries in the process. If you're experienced with releasing apps on the App Store already, you'll find ample advice on how to transition away from the Mac App Store.

After reading this book, you'll be able to quickly add license code verification to an existing app and only let users  who pay continue with your app. If you want, you can even offer a store front from right within your application using FastSpring's _Embedded Store SDK_ which may increase the conversion from demo users to paid customers. All of this is designed to work as a drop-in: you add the files to your project and don't have to worry about the details.

Then there's the part about implementing time-based trials in your app. Time-based trials are the de facto standard to limit functionality of what was used to be called "shareware" in the 1990s. Keeping track of time is another functionality you would have to add to your app but which I have taken care of. It integrates into the existing license mechanism nicely.

Next to time-based trials, it's also popular to offer feature-limited trials. There, you offer a demo version with limited capability from the start but potentially running forever. Users have to pay to unlock the full potential of the app. We won't cover that in much detail because it'll turn out that this is essentially an in-app purchase. Since you will learn how to add in-app purchases to unlock features, you can create feature-based trials, too.

All in all, you only have to take the well-factored sample code of this book and copy the parts you want to use into your own project to get started. If your app is already functional, it may take you no more than an hour to put your app under copy protection and add a time-based trial -- depending on your existing code, of course.

The sample code will be written in the latest stable version of Swift. I'll update the book regularly, so check back for a new e-book version download when you notice Swift has changed.

## Why FastSpring?

I> I'm not at all affiliated with FastSpring. I don't get any commission if you sign up with them. I love their service and got in touch when I was finishing the book -- and they in turn loved this book. So we collaborate on spreading the word. Not because they pay me (they don't) but because I trust their service and found lots of other developers who really like what FastSpring offers. They're a great choice to get started taking control of your indie app business.
I> 
I> Still, please exercise reasonable caution when I talk about FastSpring. I got in touch with a lot of the people behind the curtains at FastSpring when I wrote this book. This creates a stronger bond, and of course decreases my will to leave. When I gave a webinar for them about this book's topic in spring 2017, it felt like I was introduced to the whole family. I do my best to be helpful to you, dear reader, first and foremost, and to be far more than a evangelist could ever be.

In 2013, I picked FastSpring to sell my apps. This was mostly because of social proof. Lots of indie teams I respected were used FastSpring since before the Mac App Store even existed. I asked around, gave it a spin and immediately liked how things worked.[^socproof] And I still love their service.

[^socproof]: You can read about a small [survey from 2009](https://successfulsoftware.net/2009/10/12/a-survey-of-ecommerce-providers-for-software-vendors/) where FastSpring scored quite high.

FastSpring isn't the only service on the market. You have lots of options to handle digital purchases nowadays. To give you some perspective, I want to discuss some of the options on the market to at least handle payments, which after all is the backbone of any business:

- Paddle (<https://paddle.com>), an integrated solution to sell app licenses and offer software-as-a-service (SaaS);
- Cryptolens (https://cryptolens.io/), a licensing-as-a-service provider targeted at software developers;
- Avangate, e-sellerate, and kagi, which are are less specialized in app developers than Paddle;
- gumroad (<https://gumroad.com>) and itch.io are platforms to sell and purchase electronic downloads like games, ebooks, and apps, but without any copy protection;
- PayPal and Stripe, which only handle payment.

Let's take a moment to discuss these popular e-commerce solutions and payment processors and get a better perspective of the options available to you. We'll start at the bottom of the list with the least sophisticated approach, and work our way up.

### Payment Processors

PayPal and Stripe will handle purchases, and that's it. 

You have to figure out VAT (value-added tax) yourself and handle that in customer recipes. This is not fun, it's a messy process because the European Union has so many different regulations already. Also, there's no store-front, so you'd have to cook this up on your own. The time needed to make any store front from scratch, on top of handling payments in detail, isn't worth the comparatively low transaction fees. I wouldn't recommend starting on this tier of services.

D> **Pieter Omvlee** revealed that **Bohemian Coding**, creators of the infamous Sketch design tool, initially sold via PayPal around 8 years ago. Bohemian Coding moved to FastSpring because of the better features, namely handling VAT automatically. Even though Sketch was sold exclusively on the Mac App Store when Apple opened its doors, after re-introducing FastSpring for volume licenses it turns out their own FastSpring-based store performs better than the Mac App Store.

### Gumroad, itch.io, and other payment processors with a shared platform

Gumroad is a bit more sophisticated than mere payment processors and better suited to indie developers who just want to make a couple of bucks on the side. People sell anything on Gumroad that is an electronic download, including ebooks, computer games and apps, assets and 3D modelling rigs, and videos. You can even notify customers about updates. Their fee is currently 8.5% + $0.30 per sale by default. When you pay for their Premium plan, the fee is reduced to 3.5% + $0.30, which pays off for two dozen sales at an average app price already.[^gumroadfee]

[^gumroadfee]: If you sell 24 licenses at $10 each per month, your regular cost is `24 * ($10 * 8% + $0.30) = $26.40` for the $240 you make. With Premium at $10/month, your service fee is `24 * ($10 * 3.5% + $0.30) + $10 = $25.60`.

Gumroad offers a simple store widget you can embed on your page for instant checkouts. They also offer a shopping cart on their platform, so customers can buy different things from different vendors at once. And their payment processing includes VAT-compliant checkout via credit card and PayPal. I cannot stress the importance of not having to handle this on your own enough.

If you don't care about personalized license keys and copy protection, Gumroad is an excellent choice to get started selling zip files of your app.

Customers on Gumroad buy your stuff, but makers are at least half of their target audience. Without makers, there'd be no offerings on their platform. Compared to payment processors, where every party is equally important and everyone at large is negligible for their success, Gumroad will be more likely to talk to you when issues arise. See the sidebar about Tayler Hall's experience to see why it's important to be of importance.

D> **Tyler Hall** started his business by selling VirtualHostX via PayPal from 2007--2009, too. But he switched once a friend of his was locked out of PayPal due to "suspicious" activity. Imagine your sales going strong, then suddenly your payment processor blocks your account. That equals sudden death (or at least a severe and prolonged coma) for your business.

D> Account terminations happen all over the internet. There are many recorded incidents of people using amazon to sell books or being an affiliate. Then there was this weird story in late 2016 about an app named "Dash" which was removed from the Mac App Store when the developer's account was terminated, apparently without prior notice to the developer, Kapeli. The point is: you can't do a thing when that happens to you.[^dash]
Apple, PayPal, and amazon are huge, so false positive charges and account terminations are inevitable. Apple also needs to be proactive to protect their customers -- which is not you, the developer, but the end user browsing the App Store. To be selling on your own turns the whole matter around and puts it back on its feet: To an e-commerce provider, you are the store owner and you are their customer. They do business with you. The end user is your responsibility, not theirs. That is a huge difference.

  [^dash]: In 2016, Dash, the popular documentation browser for Mac, was removed from the App Stores because the developer's account was cancelled. This can happen quickly and the lack of control from your side is threatening. (Read more on my website: <https://christiantietze.de/posts/2016/10/dash-removed-from-app-stores/>) It turned out Apple _did_ have a point, but everyone could have handled the issue a lot better. In hindsight, the developer said, "I was lucky to have setup a direct way of distributing Dash a while ago and as a result I’ve been mostly unaffected by the removal from the App Store." ([Source](https://blog.kapeli.com/100-days-without-the-app-store))

Itch.io is similar in features, but positions itself differently. It started as a way for indie game developers to have their own little early access program and sell work-in-progress outside big platforms like Steam and GOG. You can now purchase many different kinds of digital goods on itch.io, including non-game software like developer tools. The audience browsing around the site will probably be gamers, but that doesn't have to affect you as a seller.

Both Gumroad and Itch.io offer dedicated product pages. Gumroad's are more like small widgets; itch.io's are self-contained web sites you can customize to your will.

Itch.io propagate "pay what you want" (with an optional minimum price) for buyers, and "open revenue sharing" for sellers, with VAT handling as an optional offer. This means you decide how many percent per sale you want to give to itch.io (0--100%), and customers can decide how much they want to pay you. Their whole community is build around this model:

> You might be saying "well that sounds pretty risky, what if everyone sets it to 0?" We think that's a risk we're willing to take in the spirit of encouraging the generous and supportive community that's already developed around itch.io.  
> ---itch.io announcement via <https://itchio.tumblr.com/post/112709605589/>

The community is also very forgiving: Some folks there deploy updates to their game DLC via Google Drive. If that's your cup of indie, you might feel right at home there!

### Licensing as a service

In recent years, a new kind of web service emerged: one targeted at software developers to manage customer licenses.

There are different services on the market. DevMate, which sadly has shut down as of 2019, was one of these. Another one I stumbled upon is Cryptolens. Their client-side API looks refreshingly simple. Services like Cryptolens take care of update deployment (to paying customers), payment processing, and elaborate licensing tiers including in-app purchases. Cryptolens comes at a monthly service cost with the first non-free tier starting at $10/month for 10 or more  customers and goes up to $350/month for over 1000 customers.

A monthly cost doesn't make sense for single payment purchases: once you sell 1000 licenses, you'll burn through your cash very quickly. Subscription pricing can offset the recurring cost of such a license-as-a-service provider way better.

Neither I nor any Mac developer I know have tried licensing-as-a-service like this, so the best advise I can give here is to screen a couple of providers for their service fees and see if your pricing model matches theirs.

### E-commerce platforms with custom stores

Like FastSpring, Kagi and e-sellerate are apt to create a real custom e-stores. They're the closest competitors to FastSpring as far as I'm concerned. All of them take care of handling VAT during checkout for you, which otherwise is a mess for customers from the European Union. 

What sets FastSpring apart from these direct competitors?

Here's a subjective argument pro FastSpring: FastSpring is known for their great customer service. For example, they offer you to take care of the initial store design _for free._ They are super responsive all day, every day. A few people I interviewed procatively pointed out they were happy with the quick and helpful responses -- even though I didn't ask about any of this in the beginning. That's my experience, too: you can rely on them getting back to you in no time.

If you live outside the U.S., rest assured that FastSpring pays on time, twice a month, every month. I'm located in Germany, so I expected trouble when receiving payments from a California-based company -- but FastSpring handles payments to bank accounts in the European Union perfectly. I don't lose revenue due to currency conversion, either, since they don't increase their fees when you live outside the U.S. This isn't common practice.

From a customer's perspective, purchasing your software is simple and attractive, too. You'll see screenshots later in the book. FastSpring improved their web store designs for app developers in recent years and now provide a user experience comparable to you hosting the store on your own. It's seamless. On top of this, FastSpring's [list of payment methods](https://www.fastspring.com/payment-methods-and-security) is huge. As I said above, credit cards aren't common in Germany, so people will be happy to be able to resort to PayPal or wire transfer if you enable these options. Wire transfer takes a couple of days, but it's useful to have.


D> **Ironic Software** use Kagi and FastSpring next to each other: having two stores (plus the Mac App Store) surprisingly results in more sales for them. FastSpring is Ironic's Tom Andersen's favorite, though, because the backend is so nice to use.

### Paddle

Lastly, Paddle is a different kind of competitor. Paddle's service is centered around developer integration from the start. 

FastSpring is a general e-commerce service provider which happens to provide integration with license generation scripts and your wesite and app via a general-purpose API. FastSpring is aware of software developer's needs, but not everything they do revolves around folks like you and me. 

Paddle offers a simple SDK to set up trials, in-app purchases, and license verification. It's like everything we'll discuss in this book, only without you having to do a thing.

Their service seemed to fit perfectly, so I gave it a spin in 2013. I tried the SDK in my first shipping app and learned a lot along the way -- but I didn't feel comfortable because of the lack of _control._ I couldn't reliably find out how their stuff is working. There was no way to issue test purchases from within the app to see if the right events are raised. So in the end I didn't use Paddle at all.

FastSpring offers a test store front on the web and from within the app if you do in-app purchases. That's very convenient to see if your checkout works and if your app transitions from "locked" to "paid". 

Although the amount of control FastSpring offers will make your job as a developer harder at first, once you nailed it and connect the dots it's dead simple to use.

I know people who are very happy with Paddle. By all means, try it out yourself! If you're happy with what they offer, that's great!

I'll be waiting here for you in case you want to take a bit more control over the process without any of the headache of figuring things out on your own.

That's the ultimate goal of this book: **get all the obstacles out of your way so you can start using FastSpring in your app today.** This is no hyperbole. Depending on your reading speed, you can start reading this book in the morning and have working license verification implemented by the end of the day.

You don't have to poke around to find any edge cases. Let this book and the sample code take care of the implementation details and pitfalls so you can focus on developing your product and selling it online _and make you some of that sweet, sweet money._ :)

## Structure of the Book

The process I'll show you isn't complicated, but I separated the implementation into multiple steps so you can learn how to scale everything. Here's a quick synopsis of the upcoming chapters.

**Chapter 1** is about getting comfortable with FastSpring. You'll set up your web store and add your product in such a way that people could start buying it. Having this part of the process ready helps when you test if the application code does its job.

The implementation in your app is split up in two parts explained in the next two chapters, so you can take whatever you need and leave the rest. They are very practical and there's an accompanying example app for each chapter for quick reference.

**Chapter 2** will teach you how to add the code for app activation. When you have done this, you can verify that the FastSpring code generator works as expected. You can upload the resulting app for sale already, but people would have to buy a license up front, much like paid-up-front downloads in the App Store. But that's not very attractive, so ...

**Chapter 3** will show the process of implementing a time-based trial mode in your application to enable users to test-drive your app for a while. This chapter is technical, and we'll discuss different trial options. The trial mode is purely your app's responsibility and will not affect your setup with FastSpring.

**The Appendix** is a collection of self-contained sections that explain how to implement more than the basic features.
