## How to Sell Bundles on FastSpring {#sellbundles}

FastSpring offers an amazing service to handle bundle payment processing. If your fellow developers are from different countries, FastSpring handling the payments can spare you a lot of the headache.

The mechanism behind that is called [split pay][spay] and is used for affiliates, too, for example.

Basically, all participants register at FastSpring and provide their bank account details. One becomes the host of the bundle. All participant's products have to find their way into the host's store -- including order fulfillment for license code generation. Then the host sets up a [product bundle][bundle] with all the bundle products and a bundle price.

While the host adds each product to the bundle, it's important to set the products to "No-Price / Zero-priced option" so only the bundle price counts.

The bundle participants have to sign up at the host's store as [the docs][spay] indicate, via the store-specific payee URL: `http://www.fastspring.com/signup_payee.php?ci=companyid`

Once the payee has been approved by FastSpring in a manual review process, you can set up split pay rules for them. Common parameters include: begin date, end date, split percent, then filtered by site, origin of the link, coupon used, product bought. The last option is what you're after: select the bundle from the list.

<!--ct: TODO can you edit this list later?-->

Also consider setting up [notifications][notif] for each order. Ask bundle participants if they'd like to be notified instantly or if they preferred a list of customers at the end of the bundle sale.
