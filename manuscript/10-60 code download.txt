In the GitHub repository, you'll find two example projects:

* `No-Trial-Verify-at-Start`: the simple one. The real application is blocked until the user registers as a paying customer. It supports buying a license from within the app using the Embedded Web Store SDK by FastSpring.
* `Trial-Expire-While-Running`: the complex one. A time-based trial means the app is unlocked from day 1 until the trial expires. Then the application will lock itself and urge the user to register or buy. Also supports buying a license from within the app.

Both projects use secure license code verification, powered by CocoaFob.

License code generation will be powered by FastSpring, as explained in the next chapter.

Once your product is set up with FastSpring, you need to add the details to `FastSpringCredentials.plist` which is used by the sample apps to load the embedded store with the correct details.
