# Sample App 1: How to Verify License Codes in Your App {#chapter2}

According to the license template `#{product},#{name}` the license code is just an encrypted form of, for example, "`MyNewApp,Christian Tietze`".

A license code is invalid when checked against that template if it satisfies at least one of the following criteria:

* It's not actually a string encrypted by a private key matching the public key known to the app.
* The extracted application name doesn't match or is missing.
* The extracted licensee name doesn't match the name the user provides or is missing.

We need to embed the CocoaFob algorithms and create an interface like the one pictured above to actually consume license information in the app. This way users will unlock the app's functionality after a purchase.

D> **Tyler Hall** researched the rates of piracy of his apps and found out 83% of the users of VirtualHostX were using a pirated copy. Piracy was strong for quite some time -- until he added server-side validation to unlock license codes. 
D> I remember how badly gamers reacted when single-player computer games required an internet connection on first launch. That was a lot of years ago. Nowadays you can assume permanent connectivity for most of your customers.

D> In his [blog post](https://tyler.io/experimenting-with-piracy/) on piracy, Tyler listed a few other measures against software piracy that did lower the number a bit, too, although not by much. Bugging the user with a personalized guilt-laden information dialog converted about 5%. Giving pirates a one-time discount to convert to real customers worked for about 11%. Remember what Craig Scott said about turning angry prospects into happy customers? It seems to work with people who want to use your app for longer than just the trial period, too. The deal has to be good from their point of view.
