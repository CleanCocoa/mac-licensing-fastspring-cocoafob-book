# Sample App 1: How to Verify License Codes in Your App

![The "Enter a License" window of _New App_.](images/20-050-license-window.png)

According to the license template `#{product},#{name}` the license code is just an encrypted form of, for example, "`MyNewApp,Christian Tietze`".

A license code is invalid when checked against that template if it satisfies at least one of the following criteria:

* It's not actually a string encrypted by a private key matching the public key known to the app.
* The extracted application name doesn't match or is missing.
* The extracted licensee name doesn't match the name the user provides or is missing.

We need to embed the CocoaFob algorithms and create an interface like the one pictured above to actually consume license information in the app.

**You can find a fully functional sample app in the book's code repository.** It's in the [`No-Trial-Verify-at-Start` folder.](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-licensing-fastspring-cocoafob/tree/master/No-Trial-Verify-at-Start)
