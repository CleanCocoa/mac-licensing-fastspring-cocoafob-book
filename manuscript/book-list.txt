G> - **Exploring Mac App Development Strategies**, where I show how a modularized and scalable app can be built even when you decide to use Core Data for persistence, which is usually entangled everywhere.
G> - In **Creating Multi-Process Mac Applications** I show how an app can utilize and communicate with XPC services effectively to perform tasks in the background and sync data between different processes.
