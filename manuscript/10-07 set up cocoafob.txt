## Configure License Code Generation via CocoaFob

![Choose CocoaFob-based license generation from the fulfillment options](images/10-101-generate-license.png)

You will find license code generation under "Fulfillment Actions" at the bottom.

There's a plethora of actions to chose from. You can send customizable e-mails with the license code (which I recommend), you can sign an e-book with the customer's name as a means to protect the PDF from being copied, or you can ship a volume with the software as a physical object. I find PDF signing pretty cool if you want to sell e-books and worry about file-sharers. Then again there are websites which buy books, sign them with their URL, and give the copy away for free. They probably monetize through ads.

So add a fulfillment action, pick "Generate a License" from the options, and use CocoaFob. Hit "Next".

Pick a name for CocoaFob to use for the licenses. This doesn't have to be the same as your FastSpring product ID or product name (`newapp` or "New App" in my case, respectively).

In fact, you can use the product name field of the license generator to include versioning information or whatever you want to differentiate generated licenses.
